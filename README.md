# O-Rented
Final Project of OOP Course - Binus University 2022_2023

This is a simple Java GUI program made based on renter POV in renting a car. We made this program using Netbeans IDE 12.0. The program should start from main.java that will execute a new JFrame LoginPage.java. 

## Account
To access the program, a pre-made account is required. Please use one of these sample account in the login page:
agus69 (password: agusus69)

bambang4646 (password: bambank46)

## Main Menu
Once login is succesfull, the program should close the login page and open the main page which contains button for renting a car and view past rent schedules. The history page should be empty when it first opened. You can fill the history page by renting a car in the rental page. Another thing to remember is, please create a file named "schedule.txt" and replace the directory in RentalPage.java and HistoryPage.java.
