# O-Rented
Final Project of OOP Course - Binus University 2022_2023

This is a simple Java GUI program made based on renter POV in renting a car. We made this program using Netbeans IDE 12.0. The program should start from main.java that will execute a new JFrame login.java. Please use one of these sample account in the login page:

agus69 (password: agusus69)

Then the program should closes the login page and opens the main page which contains button for renting a car and view past rent schedules. The history page should be empty when it first opened. You can fill the history page by renting a car in the rental page.
